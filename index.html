                        <p> Hi, I'm Kaitlyn Billington, a current Geography: Data Science at the University of Washington. In my time here at UW, I have had the 
                            opportunity to pursue my interests in data analysis in the field of geography, while also exploring the fields of Business and Informatics. 
                            I am passionate about data organization and management, and I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting. Outside of academics, 
                            I was able to further my passion for dance as an athlete on the UW Dance Team where I developed strong teamwork and leadership skills, 
                            serving as the team's co-captain during my final year. This experience has allowed me to enhance my abilities to collaborate effectively and 
                            manage my time efficiently, while also allowing me to explore the United States through travel and performance opportunities, giving me 
                            first hand experience in diverse environments.

                        </p>
                        <p> Looking ahead, I am most interested in pursuing opportunities in data analysis and management, but I am also open to exploring roles in related fields such as
                            business intelligence and geographic information systems. My current goal is to get into a business setting where I can gain practical experience 
                            and further develop my skills and interests.
                        </p>
