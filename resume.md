# Summary

I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, with course work based in geography, data science, information management, and business. This has allowed me to gain proficiency in Microsoft systems, many programming languages (java, python, html, R, and SQL), as well as GIS like QGIS and ArcGIS. This learning has prepared me for this position by giving me the background to continue growing these skills, taught me the process in producing this content, allowed me to practice working in diverse teams, and has given me the resources to continue learning about this field.
