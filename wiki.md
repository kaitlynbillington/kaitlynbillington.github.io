Dave Matthes Band (DMB) is an American rock band formed in 1991. The band gets its name from the lead singer and guitarist: Dave Matthews, and has continued to grow and change through the years. Currently, the band consists of Dave Matthews, Tim Reynolds (electric guitar), Carter Beauford (drums), Stefan Lessard (bass guitar), Jeff Coffin (saxophone), Buddy Strong (keyboard), and Rashawn Ross (trumpet). The band has an extensive discography, and continues to be recognized for their incredible live shows. The band is well known for playing their songs differently each time they are performed, making each show unique and meaningful for fans.

## History
### The Beginning
The band begun in late 1990 when lawyer Ross Hoffman befriended bartender Dave Matthews, encouraging him to record demos of the songs Matthews had written. With these demos, the two looked outward to musicians who could help complete the sound, eventually getting local drummer Carter Beauford, as well as jazz musician LeRoi Moore. In interview, Matthews recalls that he wasn't looking for a drummer or a saxophonist, he just enjoyed the people and the music they made. He asked the two to play how they want over the demos, not worrying so much about fitting a particular vision. 

As they continued to play and experiment, they wished to fill in their limited instrumentals, adding Stefan Lessard as a bassist. In 1991, they added waiter Peter Griesar as their first keyboardist, as well as violinist Boyd Tinsley (who did not become a full-time member until 1992). 

Together, they recorded their first in-studio demo in early 1991, playing their first public show that April. The band continued playing live events at places like Flood Zone, Trax nightclub, Muse Music Club, and some fraternities. Their first official release, *Remember Two Things*, came November 9, 1993 on the Bama Rags label (re-released by RCA in 1997). This album debuted as the highest independent entry on college charts, being certified platinum by the RIAA in 2002.

### The Breakthrough
DMB released its first live EP, *Recently*, in 1994, with their debut studio album, *Under the Table and Dreaming*, coming out September 27, 1994. Some notable hits on this album include *What Would You Say*, *Satellite*, and *Ants Marching*. This album was certified six times platinum, and is what launched the band to global fame. With this, and their following *Crash* album (released April 30, 1996), the band received multiple Grammy nominations and secured their first Grammy Award for their song *So Much to Say*.

With new guests, Dave Matthews Band returns to the studio to compose their third studio album *Before These Crowded Streets*, released on April 28, 1998. This album featured hits like *Stay (Wasting Time)*, *Crush*, and *Don't Drink the Water*. The album was quick to success, selling over 900,000 albums in the first week of its release.
